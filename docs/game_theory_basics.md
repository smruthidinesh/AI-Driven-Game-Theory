# Game Theory Basics

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Players
These are the individuals or entities who make decisions in the game. Each player aims to maximize their own payoff.

### 2. Strategies
A strategy is a complete plan of action for a player in a game, specifying what choices the player will make at every decision point.

### 3. Payoffs
Payoffs represent the utility or benefit a player receives at the end of the game, depending on the strategies chosen by all players.

### 4. Equilibrium
An equilibrium is a state where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

## Types of Games

### 1. Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games
- **Simultaneous Games**: Players make their decisions at the same time, without knowing the choices of others.
- **Sequential Games**: Players make decisions in a specific order, and later players have some knowledge of earlier players' actions.

### 2. Complete vs. Incomplete Information
- **Complete Information**: All players know the payoffs and strategies available to all other players.
- **Incomplete Information (Bayesian Games)**: Players do not have full knowledge about the characteristics or payoffs of other players.

## Classic Examples

### 1. Prisoner's Dilemma
A classic example of a simultaneous game where two individuals acting in their own self-interest do not produce the optimal outcome. It illustrates the conflict between individual rationality and collective rationality.

### 2. Battle of the Sexes
A coordination game with two pure strategy Nash equilibria, where players prefer to coordinate but have different preferences on which outcome to coordinate on.

### 3. Nash Equilibrium
A concept where each player's strategy is an optimal response to the strategies of the other players. No player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone.

### 4. Centipede Game
A sequential game that highlights the tension between cooperation and self-interest, often solved using backward induction.
